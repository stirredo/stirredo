# Hi there, I'm Abhishek! üëã

I'm a passionate programmer with a love for learning and exploring new technologies. My journey began at the age of 16 when I started editing WordPress plugins in PHP and JavaScript scripts as a freelancer. Since then, I've been obsessed with understanding the inner workings of languages and frameworks, constantly comparing them and devouring programming books.

## üîß Skills & Tools

- Programming Languages: PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Java
- Web Development: WordPress, Laravel, React, Node.js, Rails
- Databases: MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL
- DevOps: Docker, AWS, Terraform
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Recommendation Engines 
- Data-Centric Frameworks: Spark, Kafka, Flink 

## üå± Projects

### 1. [deepworktimer.com](https://deepworktimer.com)

Deep Work Timer is an app that helps users overcome procrastination and improve focus by utilizing the Pomodoro Technique and providing detailed reports and data on user activity. While working on this project, I learned the importance of scalability and explored various approaches for serving real-time analytics using different types of databases.

### 2. [codematics.com](https://codematics.com)

At Codematics, a marketing technology that helps businesses identify and convert anonymous website visitors into leads, I had the opportunity to apply technologies like Apache Spark, Apache Kafka with Flink, Elasticsearch, and the ELK stack for serving real-time analytics.

### 3. [exelocker.xyz](https://exelocker.xyz)

EXELocker is a free, open-source application that allows users to password-protect executable files using strong AES-256 encryption. It offers features like locking any executable program, creating backups, and providing a user-friendly interface. Building this project taught me the value of test-driven development and writing resilient tests.

## üìö Learning Journey

Throughout my programming journey, I've realized the importance of making software more maintainable through SOLID principles and design patterns. I've also delved into the world of machine learning and deep learning, completing courses and incorporating time series data into my projects.

I'm particularly interested in recommendation engines and have read books on how Spotify, Facebook, and LinkedIn use graph-based algorithms for recommendations. I'm currently seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge of machine learning in my work.

## üåü Continuous Learning

I dedicate my weekends to learning new skills and satisfying my curiosity by watching courses on Udemy and reading books on subjects that pique my interest. Continuous learning has been an integral part of my growth as a programmer, and I'm always excited to take on new challenges and opportunities.
